This script defines a utility class ApprovalRequesterUtil in ServiceNow, which extends the AbstractAjaxProcessor class. The utility class is used to check if a user is self-approving a document.

The class has the following methods:

isSelfApprovingClient(): This method is used to check if the client user is self-approving a document. It takes the document ID from the client-side parameters and checks if the user who requested the approval is the same as the current user.

isSelfApprovingServer(current): This method is similar to isSelfApprovingClient(), but it’s used on the server side. It takes a GlideRecord object as an argument and checks if the user who requested the approval for the document associated with this GlideRecord is the same as the current user.

checkSelfApproving(document_id): This method is used by both isSelfApprovingClient() and isSelfApprovingServer() methods to check if the user who requested the approval for a document (identified by its ID) is the same as the current user. It returns true if they are the same, false otherwise.

The type of this utility class is ‘ApprovalRequesterUtil’. This class can be used in ServiceNow scripts to prevent users from self-approving documents.

var ApprovalRequesterUtil = Class.create();
ApprovalRequesterUtil.prototype = Object.extendsObject(AbstractAjaxProcessor, {
    isSelfApprovingClient: function() {
        return this.checkSelfApproving(this.getParameter('sysparm_document_id'));
    },

    isSelfApprovingServer: function(current) {
        return this.checkSelfApproving(current.document_id);
    },
	
	checkSelfApproving: function(document_id) {
		var approvalGr = new GlideRecord('sn_vul_change_approval');

        if (approvalGr.get(document_id) && approvalGr.getValue('requested_by') == gs.getUserID()) {
            return true;
        }
		
        return false;
	},

    type: 'ApprovalRequesterUtil'
});
